# Image Caption Generator

This project is an AI-powered image captioning system that takes an image as input and generates a human-like descriptive caption. It uses a pre-trained EfficientNet CNN for image feature extraction and a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model for sequence generation. The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, with performance improved using data augmentation and GAN-based image enhancement. The code is cleanly organized following OOP, OOD, and SOLID principles.
